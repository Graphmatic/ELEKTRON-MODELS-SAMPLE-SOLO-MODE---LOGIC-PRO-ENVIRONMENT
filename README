There is a Logic Pro X environment that make MUTE buttons on ELEKTRON MODELS:SAMPLE to act as SOLO buttons. Radio mode only.

    Open project with LOGIC PRO, setup the M:S so Track 1 respond to MIDI channel 1, track 2 to MIDI channel 2 and so on.
    As I’ve not found other solution to switch the SOLO mode ON/OFF from the M:S interface, the FADE setting of LFO (in LFO SETUP menu) of Track 1 is used:
    O value disable SOLO Mode (PADs act normal MUTE)
    1 value activate the SOLO Mode

To use another CC to switch the mode on/off (if you have a spare button on another MIDI control surface), open the Environment window of Logic and choose the layer called “M:S SOLO MODE”. On the left, find the cable selector labeled “SETUP SOLO MODE ON/OFF CC” and configure it as you need.
Near this cable selector, a transformer module allow to remap CC’s range if needed.
You may have to connect the M:S pin of Logic “physical input” module to the monitor module just below.

PADs LEDs on the Models:Sample are accurate.
It should work with Model:Cycles too, as MIDI implementation for MUTE are the same.


The template also provide an easy to use interface that allow to access 3 more LFO reset modes (Sample & Hold, One cycle and Half cycle), only available on the M:S control surface from Velocity Modulation. So, you will be able to P.lock this lfo retrigger modes or to use them without requiring Velocity modulation to be activated...


To:Do:
 - Tested using the USB port of M:S only, should work with DIN MIDI ports, but MIDI loop may happen if M:S MIDI OUT is set to THRU ...(?)
